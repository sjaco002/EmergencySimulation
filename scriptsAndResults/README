Two files are altered in the one simulator:
1) default_settings.txt
2) DTNHost.java
ALL OTHER FILES ARE DEFAULT ONE SIMULATOR FILES

run.sh runs the full program, including:

generatedate.sh:
1) Compiles and runs the one simulator in ../oneSimulator to produce output file with all three datasets logged
2) Converts the output file into a seperate ADM file for each dataset (reports, locations, shelters)

convertToADM.py:
1) turns the log into individual ADM output

runAsterixCOmmands.py:
1) Loads the datasets 
2) Uses a feed to keep inserting user locations and reports
