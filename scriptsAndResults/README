Two files are altered in the one simulator:
1) default_settings.txt
2) DTNHost.java
ALL OTHER FILES ARE DEFAULT ONE SIMULATOR FILES

Output to logs happens in DTNHost.update:
200 shelters are created at time 0.1
10 emergencies happen every second produced by 10 different rapidly moving users:
	3 fires
	5 floods
	1 crash
	1 storm 
Each user updates location every ten seconds
Six groups of users: 2 pedestrians groups, 1 driving group, and 3 metro groups
	Each group has 835 nodes, with each node representing 100 users, for a total of 501,000 users on 50,100 unique paths

Logs are output to file specified in logging.properties


run.sh runs the full program, including:

generatedate.sh:
1) Compiles and runs the one simulator in ../oneSimulator to produce output file with all three datasets logged
2) Converts the output file into a seperate ADM file for each dataset (reports, locations, shelters)

convertToADM.py:
1) turns the log into individual ADM output

runAsterixCOmmands.py:
1) Loads the datasets 
2) Uses a feed to keep inserting user locations and reports
